            "content" => "Whether it's mastering the challenging climb on a mountain bike route with support, going on relaxed weekend tours with friends, or arriving at the office without breaking a sweat despite a 15-kilometer commute. <br /><br />There are countless reasons why more and more cyclists are turning to an electric bike. No wonder! After all, you can now find every common type of bicycle as an e-bike. In other words, there is a right electric bike for every need. But what are the advantages of powered bikes? And what should you look out for if you're thinking about getting one yourself? E-Bike at a glance: The most important info‍ The drive is the heart of the e-bike. e-bikes come in three variants. A front-wheel drive is the most cost-effective variant, with which normal bikes can almost always be retrofitted. But, it is not optimal for the riding experience. If you are doing sporty off-road biking, you will mainly find bikes with rear-wheel drive. Mid-engines installed directly in the frame give the most stable running behavior and a very pleasant riding experience. If you are interested in e-bikes, you will always come across the term pedelec. This is how the bikes differ:The pedelec pedalling motion is electrically assisted. This extra drive is switched off at speeds of over 25 km/h. The pedelec is considered a bicycle, can be ridden on bike paths, and does not require a helmet (but a helmet is recommended anyway because of the speed).The real e-bike has a handle to accelerate and can, therefore, be moved without pedalling. Its maximum speed is 20 km/h. It is legally considered a light moped and, therefore, requires an operating licence. It is also subject to insurance. The S-pedelec also only provides pedalling assistance, but can reach speeds of up to 45 km/h. This type of e-bike needs an operating licence, is subject to insurance, and requires a class M driver's licence. With an S-pedelec, you are not allowed to ride on normal bike paths. And be sure you have a helmet; they are  required. The advantages of electric bikes compared to bicycles and carsTo what extent an e-bike is worthwhile for you, of course, always depends on how often you use it. Compared to a normal bike, the biggest advantages are the following:It's less strenuous! You create good speeds with less muscle power, which provides a lot of driving fun.The drive adapts to your needs. For example, you can get help on the drive to work. This way, you don't arrive at the office completely exhausted, but you can ride home without electric support. In this way, you can challenge yourself according to your fitness level.An e-bike motivates you to ride. After all, you know you can handle long distances or challenging inclines well.You will no longer be left behind. Especially in a group, an e-bike increases the riding fun because even if you don't have quite as much endurance as your experienced cyclists friends, you can still keep up and can be part of the group on longer tours. Of course, if you're thinking about buying an e-bike as an alternative to a car, there are a whole host of other benefits. The biggest benefits are:You are climate-friendly on the road. Compared to a car, the electric bike's engine is more environmentally friendly and emits no emissions.You don't get stuck in traffic jams. After all, you can ride an e-bike or pedelec on bike paths and get from point A to B in no time. This is especially true in bike-friendly cities. You're doing something for your health. Because even if you are assisted by the drive while cycling, you are in motion much more than when driving a car. You save money. Compared to a normal bike, an e-bike is quite expensive. But if you really want to use it as an alternative to a car, a motorised bike is cheaper. Tips for buying your electric bikeThere's no question that owning your own e-bike is an investment. The cheapest models are now available from around €1,700. Brand-name e-bikes can quickly run you between €3,000 and €4,000. It is, therefore, all the more important that you choose a bike that really suits you. That's why we recommend buying an electric bike locally at a bike shop - especially if it's your first e-bike. Here you can test ride a wide variety of models and get extensive advice. E-bike tests can also be a good starting point to get an overview of different manufacturers and their ratings. But don't rely solely on a test result. After all, every cyclist is different, and not every e-bike is suitable for you. Are you still unsure? Are you not ready to commit to an e-bike yet? Then simply test the motorised bikes by renting one. In this article, you will find various providers that have e-bikes that can be rented by the day or by the month in a subscription model.",

            "title" => "eBike vs Car: Can an Electric Bike Replace a Car?",
            "content" => "Are you looking to make a change in your routine, or simply just tired of being stuck in traffic all day? Maybe you want to stop driving altogether or, at the very least, decrease the amount of time spent in your vehicle. But in reality, can an ebike replace a car fully? Making the decision between an e-bike vs car may seem like a big decision to make, but we are here to let you know why it isn’t.So, which is better? We’re here to help you decide.If you’re considering ditching your car for an electric bike, but are still on the fence about the decision, keep reading below to learn more about all of the advantages and disadvantages of each mode of transportation and which one is better for you.ADVANTAGES OF AN ELECTRIC BIKE VS CAR. There are lots of reasons to consider choosing an ebike instead of a car for your daily commute, ranging from improving your physical health or having a positive impact on the environment. Let’s take a look at a few of the great things about owning an electric bike in more detail.They're Fun to UseEbikes allow each rider to feel more in touch with their surroundings. Whether it be their local neighbourhood, city, or mountain view, an electric bike gives you incomparable freedom. Additionally, ebikes allow you to enjoy all of nature’s finest gifts, which is something that you don’t often get to do when spending an excessive amount of time in your car. Ultimately, ebikes just make life a little bit more fun.Saves You MoneyIn the long-term, ebikes are massive cost savers compared to cars. While they may be an expensive initial purchase, when you add in the expenses of registration fees, insurance fees, tires, maintenance and repair, and depreciation, you will find that an electric bike is much more friendly to your budget. While ebikes may not be able to fully replace car trips for long travel over a certain amount of miles, it's safe to say that they may decrease not only the amount of time spent in your car, but will also reduce the amount of money you put into them every year. When comparing the cost of maintenance on an ebike vs car, ebikes rack up a lot of extra savings.Keeps you HealthyWhen you ride your e-bike, it’s much like riding a regular bike, which means you get the same physical advantages. Most electric bikes are powered by pedal assist, which means you will still be getting a good workout. Moreover, if you have somewhere to be and don’t want to smell sweaty from an intense workout, you can increase the pedal assistance to prevent yourself from smelling foul, while still making a healthy choice for your body.Dodge TrafficOne of the best things about using an ebike is the fact that you can now worry much less about heavy traffic. Not only does an ebike allow you to manoeuvre through traffic more quickly - and you have your own bike lane - but it also provides you with more alternate paths to your destination. In some cases, you’ll find that you can shorten the distance from where you are and where you need to be as you are no longer confined to taking only roads and highways. Environmentally-FriendlyAbove all, using an ebike is an environmentally-friendly decision to make. We all love cars - even electric cars - but the number of pollutants generated by them is quite massive. Not only does using an electric bicycle cut down on your costs, but it also cuts down your carbon footprint, making you more environmentally responsible. DISADVANTAGES OF AN ELECTRIC BIKE VS CARWhile there are many great things about using an ebike, they also come with a few unique challenges.They Can be ExpensiveEven after you do the maths on an electric bike vs car, ebikes are still more expensive than what you would pay for a traditional bicycle. Additionally, you will also want to consider things like insurance, accessories, and the necessary equipment that you will need to ride your e-bike. While this is still much lower than the cost of a car, it’s something to consider before purchasing a bike.They're HeavyWhile most bicycles are rather lightweight and easy to transport, ebikes are a different story. With most ebikes weighing nearly 40 pounds, not including equipment, an ebike isn’t a bicycle that you can simply sling over your shoulder. DISADVANTAGES OF A CAR VS AN ELECTRIC BIKEAs with everything, a car also has some disadvantages, as well. Expensive to MaintainRegardless of if you own a used or a new car, there is still a hefty price tag that comes with maintaining a vehicle. From the initial upfront cost to inevitable repairs and maintenance costs, as well as fuel cost, owning a car is much more expensive than you might think.Less ExerciseWhile driving a car may be much more comfortable, you simply aren’t getting any exercise while doing so. The amount of calories you burn while riding your e-bike is incomparable to that of driving a car.Cost BreakdownAs mentioned above, the cost of owning and running an ebike is significantly lower than that of a car. Let’s take a quick look at the breakdown of the expenses of an ebike vs car. Insurance:Car: $1,600 per yearMaintenance and Repairs:Car: Roughly $1,000 per yearEbike: Roughly $200 per year Parking Fees:Car: Roughly $125 per yearEbike: $0Fuel:Car: Roughly $1,200 per yearEbike: Roughly $60 per yearAs you can see, both options have their advantages, as well as disadvantages. At the end of the day, choosing between an ebike or car is a very personal decision and something only you can decide.",

            "title" => "Benefits of e-bikes",
            "content" => "Group of bicycles in a rowRiding an e-bike is a lot like riding a regular bike with the added boost of an electric motor. And having this motor with pedal assist has some advantages. Let's take a look at a few.Improved physical healthSome people may think that because the bike is electric and takes less effort to ride that it's not really exercise. A study conducted out of Brigham Young University and published in the Journal of Medical Internet Research found that people who ride electric bikes experience nearly as much exercise as those who ride mountain bikes without feeling as if they've had a difficult workout. The truth is that even with pedal assist, riders still have to pedal which results in burning calories. It's a great cardiovascular exercise that can help build endurance and muscle.Easier to ridePedal assist gives riders a boost. It helps with hills, inclines, and rough terrain, allowing for a smoother ride thus reducing stress on joints. You can also ride with greater power and precision than a regular bike. And it gets people cycling who may not otherwise ride a traditional bike because of physical aches and pains. Additionally, you can take longer rides without physical exhaustion.Better mental healthE-bikes make cycling more accessible and people are more likely to do it because it's easier, getting about the same workout with less effort. For those who may be living an otherwise sedentary life, riding an e-bike gets them moving and in nature. This exercise, change in scenery, and fresh air helps improve mood, reduces stress, provides for a more restful sleep, and increases productivity.Great alternative to carsE-bikes are great for commuting to work a few miles away and for running quick errands. Because it's classified as a bike, in many cities, you can ride on sidewalks and in bike lanes, and cut across parks. With alternative ways to travel to your destination, your commute can be faster than a car stuck in traffic. When people ride their e-bike instead of driving, they cut down on gas and pollution, helping to improve air quality and the environment.Faster and safeMost cyclists travel 10 to 12 mph, but an e-bike can average 20mph. E-bikes allow you to get to your destination faster than a regular bike. E-bikes are not more dangerous than regular bikes. They just have different risks. E-bikes tend to be safer than regular bikes because you can accelerate to get out of the way faster, and travel at higher speeds, keeping up with traffic.Now that you've learned the benefits of e-bikes, you'll want to consider protecting your e-bike with insurance. Your e-bike is an investment and you want to make sure you have adequate coverage for theft or damage. It's a risky move for your e-bike to be uninsured. Fortunately, there's bicycle insurance specifically for e-bikes. Electric bike insurance provides coverage between auto, home and renters insurances where there are gaps and fine print exclusions.Markel Specialty can offer a stand-alone electric bike insurance policy that insures e-bikes with power assist up to 750 watts and covers theft, damage and more. Policies start as low as $100 per year and offer a variety of coverage levels and deductible options.Each policy can be customised to fit you and your riding style. Coverages can include protection for damage caused by theft, crash, collision, fire, attempted theft, vandalism or hitting another object. Coverage of spare parts, cycle apparel, and rental reimbursement can also be included at no additional cost.Take action today and protect yourself and your e-bike.",

            "content" => "Porsche is undoubtedly one of the most iconic and instantly recognizable automotive brands in the world. While the German company has indeed been making strides in the world of electric cars, it has also been doing so in the world of electric two-wheelers, more specifically, electric bicycles.One of its newest electric bikes is simply called the Sport, and it’s a rather versatile looking two-wheeler that’s built around a carbon fibre full-suspension frame. Of course, given the fact that it’s a Porsche product, it shouldn’t come as too much of a surprise to you that this e-bike retails for quite the tidy sum of $11,750 USD. To shed some light as to why this bike costs so much, it’s partly because Porsche joined forces with fellow German company Rotwild.Rotwild is known for its ultra-sleek and premium frame designs, and the Porsche Sport is no different. Just one glance at this bike makes it clear just how well thought out the frame’s design is. For starters, it’s made of carbon fibre, and features a rear shock that’s integrated perfectly with the top tube. This keeps the bike lightweight, both physically and visually. Furthermore, the front end gets a super-sleek motorcycle-esque inverted fork. Overall, the bike provides 100 millimetres of suspension travel, making minced meat out of uneven city roads and even some light trails.From a performance perspective, the Sport is equipped with a Shimano EP8 motor that delivers 85 Nm of torque. Furthermore, with a 630-watt-hour battery this motor has a claimed range of 60 to 70 miles on a single charge. Apart from the electricals, the Sport is equipped with some premium kit consisting of an 11-speed Shimano XT Di2 to give you utmost efficiency while pedalling alongside the electric motor. Given the bike’s carbon fibre frame and lightweight drivetrain, it tips the scales at 21.2 kilograms for a medium-sized frame.",

            "title" => "What You Need to Know Before Riding an E-Bike in Europe",
            "content" => "EU regulations for e-bikesThe EU legislators must have come to the same conclusions, and they enforced some strict regulations on manufacturers willing to sell their bikes in the EU. Although the lawful limits on e-bikes have been criticised for being too lenient, the EU parliament decided that it will just put a frame in place. The national legislators could place more restrictions if they conclude it’s needed. For now, EU directive 2002/24/EC dictates the rule for all member states. According to this directive, for an e-bike to be exempt from registration and the need for a licence to ride it, it should have a motor that continuously puts out no more than 250W.Furthermore, this output should gradually be reduced as the speed of the bike increases till it reaches 25kph. The motor completely cuts off its support at this speed, and the rest is all up to your legs. Moreover, the e-bike motor shouldn’t be able to work independently as many of the rear and front hub motors can.So, for an e-bike to be legal in the EU, it should:have a motor that has a continuous input of no more than 250Whave the motor only as an assistantassists you up to 25kphBelgiumThis bike heaven decided that having just one category of e-bikes is not enough. After all, there are hundreds of types of electric bikes, and it’s only logical to separate them a bit further. So, Belgium divided the e-bikes into three separate categories.250W bikes that assist you to 25kph are deemed safe for all ages and could be ridden without a helmet.1,000W bikes that assist you up to 25 kph are categorised as “motorised bikes.” One needs to be at least 16 to ride such a bike. A conformity certificate needs to be issued as well.4,000W bikes that assist you up to 45 kph are named “speed pedelecs” and are classified as mopeds and follow their regulations.DenmarkThe world’s cycling capital surprises no one with its lenient approach to such e-bikes. Since 2018 in the former Viking kingdom, speed pedelecs have been allowed on cycling paths. To ride this super e-bike, you need to be at least 15 and wear a helmet. However, no licensing and number plates are necessary.FinlandFinland allows anyone to ride a 250W e-bike that only assists you until you reach 25kph. However, they allow powerful e-bikes on their roads, as long as they are licensed and have insurance. Nonetheless, they still should be limited to 25kph. This limitation is a must even for e-bikes with a separate driving system and assists without the rider’s input.NorwayDespite not being in the European Union, Norway follows part of the EU’s directive. However, the local government decided to add some more rules to their legislation. For example, e-bikes can only be used on bicycle infrastructure – bike paths, bike parks, etc. Going on the road or to a shared space with an e-bike may lead to a hefty fine. Furthermore, while in the EU the max assistant speed is 25kph, in Norway it’s only 20kph.SwitzerlandAnother non-EU country that has similar e-bike rules. However, since 2012, the Swiss have allowed e-bikes to have a motor with a 5,00W input, although the assistant speed limit is the same – 25kph. There is also a speed limit to autonomous motor riding – up to 20 kph.UKThe UK saw a boom in e-bike purchases, especially during the pandemic. Many people who typically use public transport for commuting decided to switch to this faster and healthier alternative. Since the UK was in the EU when the regulations were implemented, after Brexit, they just kept the rules. However, they found it necessary to add a weight limit. For an e-bike to be exempt from licensing and other motorcycle-related regulations, it needs to be no more than 30 kg. Also, riders must be at least 14 years of age to be eligible to ride an e-bike.Other countries in EuropeMost countries in the EU follow the general rules the European parliament agreed on. Also, many non-EU countries, such as Turkey, have adopted the EU directive as a basis of their own legislation on e-bikes. It’s safe to say, though, that more countries will follow the examples mentioned above and will carve their own e-bike laws that correspond with the local culture of riding, infrastructure, and other specifics.",

            "content" => "Route # 1: Classic Paris, along the SeineThis cycling route is the perfect way to admire Paris landmarks and must-see monuments.1/ It starts on Place de l’Alma, from where you have a superb view of the Eiffel Tower. Don’t miss the Flamme de la Liberté (flame of liberty), a life-size replica of the Statue of Liberty’s torch in New York City. The flame was transformed into a memorial to Lady Diana after she lost her life in a car crash in the tunnel under the Alma bridge in 1997.2/ Set off along one of those wide, beautiful Paris avenues: Avenue George V, lined with elegant private mansions, many of which now house foreign embassies. The route leads you to the Champs-Élysées; you will spot the famous restaurant Fouquet’s on the corner.3/ Cycle down the world’s most beautiful avenue, with the Arc de Triomphe behind you, until you reach Avenue Winston Churchill. Turn into the avenue, which has two must-see museums – the Grand Palais to your right and the Petit Palais to your left. At the end of the avenue, you will find yourself back on the Seine quayside, right in front of Pont Alexandre III: by far one of the most beautiful bridges in Paris.4/ Cross the bridge and bear left. The route hugs the bank of the Seine and leads you to Parc Rives de Seine, a riverside leisure area for pedestrians and cyclists only – the perfect spot for a pleasant summertime ride.5/ When you find yourself under Pont de la Concorde, walk your bike back up to the quayside and then cross the bridge to take a spin around Place de la Concorde: it’s well worth the detour. Return to the quayside and continue on your route. You’ll see the Jardin des Tuileries on your left and, to your right, the Musée d'Orsay located inside the former railway station Gare d'Orsay on the opposite bank of the Seine. A short distance from here, you’ll spot the Louvre to your left.6/ Continue cycling along the quay, past Pont des Arts, and cross the Seine on Pont Neuf to get to Île de la Cité. Circle the Île along Quai des Orfèvres until you reach Notre-Dame Cathedral, which you can visit free of charge.7/ Now take Rue d’Arcole to reach Pont d’Arcole. Re-cross the Seine and keep going straight: you’ll find yourself on the square in front of the magnificent Hôtel de Ville de Paris (Paris City Hall) – the end point of this 6.5-km route.Alternatively, you can re-cross the Seine via Rue de la Cité and cycle the same route the other way round to get to Pont de l’Alma along the opposite bank of the Seine.Route # 2: Parisians’ Paris, along the canalsThe Canal Saint-Martin winds its way through Paris over a distance of nearly 5 km, from Port de l’Arsenal, where it flows into the Seine, to Bassin de la Villette, where it becomes the Canal de l'Ourcq. This pleasant route follows the canal’s meanders.1/ Make your way from Port de l’Arsenal, a picturesque little urban port, to Place de la Bastille with the towering July Column at its center. Cycle past the huge steel and glass building housing the Opéra Bastille to get to Boulevard Richard-Lenoir. The Canal Saint-Martin runs underground here, beneath a covered-over central esplanade dotted with squares and boules pitches where big, bustling food markets are regularly held (the Bastille market every Thursday and Sunday, and the Popincourt market on Tuesday and Friday). The area’s cycle lanes are separated from car traffic, making for a stress-free ride.2/ When you come to the junction of Boulevard Richard-Lenoir and Boulevard Voltaire, turn into Boulevard Voltaire on your left. Pedal onwards for a short distance and you’ll emerge into the vast Place de la République, a pedestrian-only zone dominated by a huge statue where walkers and sports lovers congregate. Cycle along the car-free stretch to the right to reach Rue du Faubourg-du-Temple and then the Canal Saint-Martin along Quai de Jemmapes. This is a favorite haunt of Parisians, who come here to picnic on sunny days, or to frequent the many bars and restaurants in the area.3/ The canal resurfaces at this point, from where it is spanned by a series of bridges and footbridges. If you’re seized by a sudden urge to skim pebbles across the water at the little bridge fronting Rue Léon Jouhaux, there’s an obvious explanation. This is the spot where Amélie, the heroine of Jean-Pierre Jeunet’s famous film of the same name, does exactly that. There is a swing bridge in front of Rue de la Grange aux Belles. Wait here for a while; you’ll soon see a barge or sightseeing boat passing beneath the bridge. A little further on is another place that has featured in a movie: Hôtel du Nord, the setting for the classic film by Marcel Carné.4/ Keep cycling along the canal on Quai de Jemmapes until you reach Place de la Bataille de Stalingrad, with its beautiful rotunda housing a bar and restaurant. You can admire one of the canal’s double locks here.5/ Further along, the route skirts Bassin de la Villette along Quai de la Loire, another favorite spot of Parisians in summer, and one of the locations of the Paris Plages event.6/ Quai de la Loire takes you as far as Parc de la Villette, a 55-hectare park featuring large expanses of green dotted with artworks that you stumble upon in the course of your visit. It also houses the Grande Halle (used these days used to host exhibitions), the Cité des Sciences et de l'Industrie, a decommissioned submarine, and the Géode (a giant metal sphere - la Géode closes its doors from November 30, 2018, for renovation work), as well as imposing buildings designed by great contemporary architects such as Christian de Portzamparc, Adrien Fainsilber and Jean Nouvel, including the Philharmonie de Paris.Good to know: if you’re in the mood to keep going after completing this 7-km route, the cycle path along the Canal de l'Ourcq continues all the way to Claye-Souilly, 25 km to the northeast of Paris.Cycle lanes in ParisThe City of Light has a large network of cycle lanes, and new lanes are constantly being added in various districts of the capital. Designed specifically to allow people to get around Paris safely by bike, the lanes are marked out using white lines, signs and bicycle symbols. Boundary markings are placed on the road, and occasionally on pavements or bus lanes.A brochure titled Paris à vélo, le bon plan (available at the town hall of every Paris arrondissement and at the Maison du Vélo, 37 boulevard Bourdon, 75004 Paris) has a map of all the cycle paths and routes in Paris. The Geovelo app lets you plan your journey on the basis of different criteria (shortest route, flattest route, etc.). You can either opt to be guided by voice commands or follow the instructions displayed on the screen of your smartphone.",

            "title" => "Paths to Discover in France",
            "content" => "Traffic free cycling routes in FranceDid you know France has a vast car-free cycle path network? Known in French as the Voie Verte, meaning Greenways, these pieces of infrastructure are fast popping up throughout the country. The rate of dedicated cycle paths in France being built and expanded upon is ever increasing. More towns are looking to reap the benefits which separated cycling infrastructure can bring. In many areas, they stand in places where a rail line used to be. This often means they also provide you with a relatively flat cycling route.Whilst it is common to find these cycle paths built alongside canals and rivers, there are also some to explore in mountainous regions too. We definitely recommend seeking these out in the Alps and Pyrenees. Greenways in the mountains are a great way to get an easier ride in, resting those legs and avoiding steep gradients. They are also fantastic options when traveling with children or others who aren’t as confident mixing in with cars on the roads.1. Lourdes – Voie Verte des Gaves –17.5km each wayLocated in the Pyrenees, this greenway takes advantage of the disused railway line which used to run all the way to Cauterets. Now the tracks have been paved and you can enjoy a pedal along the valley floor away from the busier tourist town of Lourdes. The ride will see you take in ten smaller villages to the start of the Gorge de Luz. Check here for a full write-up of this route in our Pyrenees section.It is possible to continue on from the endpoint at Pierrefitte Nestalas all the way to Cauterets on a dirt track. If you do this you’ll need to be on a bike with wider tires to accommodate the rockier terrain.2. Annecy – Lake Annecy cycle trail to Albertville45 km each wayThis trail travels along the eastern shoreline of Lake Annecy connecting it up almost all the way to the town of Albertville. Travelling alongside the turquoise waters of the lake, you will roll through a disused rail tunnel and then pedal your way through the countryside. All the while being able to look up at the giant alpine mountains looming overhead. In fact, at points, you even have great vistas of Mont Blanc itself. At present, the trail finishes 5kms prior to reaching Albertville. Work is also underway to complete the trail around the entire perimeter of Lake Annecy.",
